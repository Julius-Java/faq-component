## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery
- [Boostrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - CSS Framwork


### What I learned

I learned about the js slideToggle method, and that for it to work an element, the elements display needs to be set to 'none'

```js
  $(selector).slideToggle(500);
```

### Continued development

I'd like to focus more on mastering the flex-box system for responsive designs
